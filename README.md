# Analyzing Stocks with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
By using Excel's Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, we are able to write scripts to automate simple tasks that help Steve analyze stocks to direct his parents on how to invest their money. By the click of a button, Steve will be able to choose what year he would like to analyze, then the tickers, total daily volumes, and yearly returns for each stock will be generated in a neatly organized table. With the ease of this process, Steve can quickly and clearly let his parents know that DQ may not be a profitable stock to invest in and guide them in the right direction.
